This game was mostly an experiment to see if I could do decently scalable multiplayer as well as getting me introduced to typescript / javascript, as I am normally in C++ or C#

Libraries used:

SAT js for fine collision (using Seperating Axis Theorem)
Node js for running server applications
Peer Server for server peer to peer brokering (downloaded from npm via npm install peer)
Peer js for client peer to peer hosting
Socket.io for server TCP connection (matchmaking) (downloaded from npm via npm install socket.io)
Socket.io.js for client TCP connection (matchmaking)
Kinetic JS for vector graphics
JQuery for misc functions, might take out if not needed

IDE: Visual Studio
Using
Typescript for Visual Studio
NodeJS tools for Visual Studio
Node for windows (testing purposes before sending to server)
